# Mangos (3.3.5 12340)

Unfortunately, at the beginning of the 2011, those projects left almost all 
experienced developers, and they have practically ceased to grow. 
I commend the people who still continue to develop original projects repository, 
but the level of development is clearly inadequate and not always competent, 
in addition, the code of the original project practically not tested and 
may cause problems while real usage.
